Installation
---
I recommend to use `Miniconda` to create a new python environment with `Python ~= 3.10`. Then, clone this repository and run the following line from the directory in which the repository was cloned with the environment being activated:

```
pip install .
```

To install the package in editable mode, you can use the command `pip install -e .` or `poetry install` if [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed.
